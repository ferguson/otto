:layout:

stars get pushed down a little when an artist line wraps in starts with view
application window is too big for some laptop screens

:bugs:
need to group owners when detecting loading events in new albums view
scan music from app menu during a scan initiates another scan
pasting in music folder content editable field (using right-click) yields some funky formatting (but seems to work)
setting owners with otto.json logic might be wrong wrt owners being set by @ in dir name
move zero years to end in all albums view
sometimes mpd hangs on certain songs i think, detect this and kill mpd & remove song from queue
seeking is scaled wrong in TV mode (it's 'doubled'), stars too
volume slider has trouble in TV mode too
make events a capped collection
searching for 'the' on big collections(?) crashes?
strange state where users isn't fully logged in or something causes stars to crash
often current song doesn't load when attaching with browser
remote play should mute local lineout if it wasn't playing
should we double the resolution of thumbnails for zooming?
channel list should not be completely rebuilt just by listener changes
channel list menu broken after a reconnect
progress bar not updating when you change channels
app: use output (lineout) status to trigger "listening" on listener list
timeout 'typing' in chat window after a sufficent period
chat window doesn't always autoscroll (might be because of smooth scrolling)
chat captures browser meta keys on some browsers and app (e.g. cmd-q)
what do to about clicking on now playing test
image resizing/caching is way too slow
stuff not loading into various, soundtracks, and unknown correctly
sound effects seem to be stepping on each other, e.g. chat message alert
log scale on volume slider
lineout volume defaults to 100% instead of 80% (or whatever the streaming player defaults to)
queue div maxes out after about 20 tracks?
audio channel options tray should default open for current channel
audio channel options tray needs a different icon (i in circle? gear?)
clicking on channel should switch to listening to it in local (lineout) mode
bug when listener changes name (extraneous 'unknown' listener stays listed until refresh)
grid background messes up on scroll (only in app and only on initial load page!)
for songs missing an image, use first image found in album
is unknown filed in ...? should it be (i can't remember if i did this on purpose)
app seems to have css problems on the second initial load page
don't put a black background behind album images (see shaped picture disc examples e.g. devo)
clear emptydatabase flag earlier in load process (so you can point a browser at it while it's still doing the initial load)?
make TV mode one of the -/+ sizes
logging out leaves things active on letter bar (and there are prob. other things that need to be reset too)
. need to reprocess stars on login
clicking on album name or artist name in now playing renders .browserresults w/o "otto" logo footer
add "x" to search box to dismiss search results
queue updates need to be split between now playing and queue changes to prevent blinking
click on landscape doesn't reset cubes
otto will think music was loaded on initial load if it finds files but can't actually load them
once saw ouroboros disappear after about 60 seconds on long load (or maybe crash) and it never came back
v remember 1/+ size setting (cookie? or local storage?)
v /nick in chat should change username
. eventually need to seperate chat nick name from username so people can have a choice
v? leaving stream too sensitive, esp. in channelbar display
v make "otto" footer only appear when there are .browserresults (and maybe only when they require scrolling down?)
v perhaps clicking on 'otto' logo at bottom should shoot to to the top of page?
v don't random pick 'audiobook' or 'podcast' labeled items
v odd big gap between owner and file in queue
v make expanded albums covers bigger? or at least check them with new /orig image url
v stars for other users don't show in showstars view
v letterbar not being clipped on narrow browser window
v chat output div slightly too wide, long lines make it sideways scrollable
v better formatting of search results
v changing channels is not quite working
v server crashes sometimes when clients reconnect after server restarts (setting focus state etc?)
v app: about box crashes (until assets are cached?)
v app: media keys lockup app on 10.7 (just don't do media keys on 10.7?)
v app: need to get and pass session cookie on Otto.py socket.io connection
v fix zipfile to unpack correctly on mac (don't use the non-compressed setting)
v rounding bug between song.length and what mpd reports as total time (round up instead of down perhaps?)
v make channelbar hover items disappear after a while (so we have a place to park the cursor on the tv)
v stars layout problems in a number of places (expand album view, search results, more...)
v search results has major layout problems
v just use orig sized image instead of 600x600 (and don't generate and store 600x600 images)
x font size off in firefox esp. for chat prompt (not font size i don't think, div off by 1px up?)
